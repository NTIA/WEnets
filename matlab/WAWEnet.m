function [allFileInfo, ctlInfo] = WAWEnet(inSpeech,varargin)
%WAWEnet.m produces one or more speech quality or intelligibility values
%for each input speech signal. This is done without the use of any 
%reference speech signals. These no-reference values are created by
%Wideband Audio Waveform Evaluation networks or WAWEnets[1]. WAWEnets are
%convolutional neural networks and they have been trained using
%full-reference objective speech quality and speech intelligibility values.
%
%Use:  [allFileInfo, ctlInfo] = WAWEnet(inSpeech, ctlInfo)
%
%--------------------------------INPUTS--------------------------------
%The only required input is inSpeech.  This may be a row or column vector
%of speech samples or a string of the form *.wav or *.txt.
%
%If inSpeech is a vector of speech samples the sample rate must be
%16,000 smp/sec, it must contain at least 48,000 samples (3 sec.) and the
%nominal range for the sample values is +/- 1.0.
%
%To best match the designed scope of WAWEnets, it should have a speech
%activity factor of roughly 0.5 or greater and an active speech level near
%26 dB below the clipping points of +/- 1.0.  (See level normalization
%feature below.)
%
%If inSpeech is a string that names a .wav file, that file must: 
%   -be uncompressed
%   -have sample rate 8, 16, 24, 32, or 48k smp/sec.
%   -contain at least 3 seconds of speech
%
%To best match the designed scope of WAWEnets, the .wav file should have a
%speech activity factor of roughly 0.5 or greater and an active speech
%level near 26 dB below the clipping points of +/- 1.0.  (See level
%normalization feature below.) The native sample rate for WAWEnets is
%16 k smp/sec so files with rates 8, 24, 32, or 48k rate are converted
%internally before processing.
%
%If inSpeech is a string that names a .txt file, each line should specify
%a .wav file that meets the .wav file requirements listed above.
%Each file will be processed in sequence. This will be slightly more
%efficient (1 or 2% reduction in run-time) than calling WAWEnet.m
%repeatedly. 
%
%ctlInfo is an optional input.  It is a structure that provides control
%information to WAWEnet.m.  Any or all of the five different fields may be
%used in any combination as follows:
%
%ctlInfo.WAWEnetMode = M invokes the WAWEnet trained using a specific
%full-reference target.
%M = 1: WAWEnet trained using WB-PESQ [2] target values (Default)
%M = 2: WAWEnet trained using POLQA [3] target values
%M = 3: WAWEnet trained using PEMO [4] target values
%M = 4: WAWEnet trained using STOI [5] target values
%
%ctlInfo.levelNormalization = L specifies internal level normalization of
%the speech input (vector or .wav file) to 26 dB below clipping.
%L = 0: normalization off
%L = 1: normalization on (Default)
%
%ctlInfo.segmentStep = S specifies the segment step (stride) and is an
%integer with value 1 or greater.  Default is S = 48,000.
%WAWEnet requires a full 3 seconds of signal to generate a result. 
%If the input speech (vector or .wav file) is longer than 3 seconds
%multiple results may be produced. S specifies the number of samples to
%move ahead in the vector or file when extracting the next segment.
%The default value of 48,000 gives zero overlap between
%segments. Using this default any input less than 6 sec. will produce one
%result, based on just the first 3 sec. A 6 sec. input will produce two
%results. If S = 24,000 for example, segment overlap will be 50%, a 
%4.5 sec. input will produce 2 results and a 6 sec. input will produce
%3 results. In all cases an additional final value is produced. That 
%value is the mean of all segment results that are associated with 
%segments that have speech activity factor greater than 0.45. If there are
%no such segments, the final result is NaN.
%
%ctlInfo.channel = C specifies a channel number to use when the input
%speech is in a multi-channel .wav file. Default is C = 1.
%
%ctlInfo.outFilename = 'myFile.txt' specifies a text file that
%captures WAWEnet results on a new line for each speech input processed.
%If the file exists it will be appended. The extension .txt will be added
%as needed. Default is that no .txt file is generated.
%
%--------------------------------OUTPUTS--------------------------------
%The output for each of the N speech signals processed is in the 1 by N
%structure allFileInfo. The fields are:
%allFileInfo.name, .wav filename or "MatlabVector"
%allFileInfo.exception, description of any exception encountered
%allFileInfo.sampleRate, native sample rate of the signal
%allFileInfo.duration, duration of the signal in seconds
%allFileInfo.activeLevel, active speech level of final segment 
%   in dB below overload
%allFileInfo.activityFactor, speech activity factor of final segment
%allfileInfo.allActivityFactors, speech activity factors for each segment
%allfileInfo.allActiveLevels, active speech level for each segment
%allFileInfo.netOut, output value(s) produced by WAWEnet.  Contains one
%value for each segment processed, plus a final value that is the mean
%over all segments that have speech activity factor greater than 0.45.
%
%ctlInfo is returned as well.  In addition to the five fields defined
%in the input section above, it also includes:
%ctlInfo.sampleRate, native sample rate for WAWEnets, always 16,000 smp/s
%ctlInfo.segmentLength, native segment length rate for WAWEnet,
%   always 48,000 smp (3 s)
%ctlInfo.outFileHeader, the header that defines results shown on screen
%   and in any output file.  This includes a starting time/date stamp.
