Usage: wawenet infile [options]

--infile is either a .wav file or a .txt file where each line specifies
a suitable .wav file (In this second case, the listed .wav files will be
processed in sequence).

A suitable wav file: 
   is uncompressed
   has sample rate 8, 16, 24, 32, or 48k 
   contains at least 3 seconds of speech
To best match the designed scope of WAWEnets, it should also have at 
least .50 speech activity factor and an active speech level near
26 dB below clipping (see level normalization feature below).
The native sample rate for WAWEnets is 16k so files with rates 8, 24, 32,
or 48k rate will be converted internally before processing.

-- use option -m M to specify a WAWEnet mode. The integer M
specifies the WAWEnet trained using a specific full-reference target.
M=1: WAWEnet trained using WB-PESQ [2] target values (Default)
M=2: WAWEnet trained using POLQA [3] target values
M=3: WAWEnet trained using PEMO [4] target values
M=4: WAWEnet trained using STOI [5] target values

-- use option -l L to specify internal level normalization of 
.wav file contents to 26 dB below clipping.
L=0: normalization off
L=1: normalization on (Default)

-- use option -s S to specify segment step (stride).
WAWEnet requires a full 3 seconds of signal to generate a result. 
If a .wav file is longer than 3 seconds multiple results may be produced.
S specifies the number of samples to move ahead in the file when
extracting the next segment. The default value of S is 48,000. This gives
zero overlap between segments and any speech file less than 6 sec.
will produce one result, based on just the first 3 sec. A 6 sec.
speech file will produce two results.
If S = 24,000 for example, segment overlap will be 50%, a 4.5 sec.
file will produce 2 results and a 6 sec. file will produce 3 results.

-- use option -c C to specify a channel number to use in the 
case of multi-channel .wav files. Default is C = 1.

-- use option -o 'myFile.txt' to specify a text file that
captures WAWEnet results for each processed .wav file on a new line.
If the file exists it will be appended. The extension .txt will be added
as needed. Default is no .txt file generated.
